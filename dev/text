Priya, Do you remember when we were in Banjara hills office, one day evening you were about to leave the office and came to me as I was crying. That day Kaumudi had a severe asthma attack and was in ICU. Rama rang me ( I told him that I was in hospital ) and asked me to submit the feature. The feature could not be submitted ealier as critial reviewer was in USA and he could not close my feature code review. That time I left my daughter in hostpital and keot my mother there and ran to office. In fact that feature is not even critical to go into that build. He is the cruelest manager I worked with so far in my entire career.
